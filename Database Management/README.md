These projects are associated with the design and manipulation of databases in SQL.

Movie Rental Database
In this project, a fictional Movie Rental Store is seeking to extract information from its pre-existing database of Movie Rentals in order to improve its sales. To assist and provide comprehensive data analysis, detailed and summary tables were created using PostgreSQL. The summarized information displays the most popular actors among customers, allowing staff to place movies featuring those actors prominently at the front of the store in order to get more rentals.

Coffee Shop Database
This project features the construction of a database to assist a fictional Coffee Shop with keeping track of information generated in its day-to-day business. The database is capable of tracking information about bagels, bagel orders, customers, and the associations between them.
